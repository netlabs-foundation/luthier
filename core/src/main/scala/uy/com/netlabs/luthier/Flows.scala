  /**
   * Convenient method to execute a code in a flow run context.
   * A special flow will be constructed for the passed code, it will run it immediately, and the be disposed.
   * This construct is useful when you must perform request using endpoints, instead of defining general purpose flows.
   *
   * '''Notes:''' Al methods that need an implicit MessageFactory, will need to be passed one explicitly (use the message)
   * unless you declare an implicit flowRun like this:
   *
   * {{{<pre>
   *   inFlow {(flow, dummyMsg) =>
   *     implicit val flowRun = dummyMsg.flowRun
   *     //your code here
   *   }
   * </pre>}}}
   * Also, to instantiate endpoints like you do in normal Flows, you need the implicit conversions declared in the flow
   * so its wise to imports its members. Summing up, to properly use this method, you should use it with this preamble:
   * {{{<pre>
   *   inFlow {(flow, dummyMsg) =>
   *     import flow._
   *     implicit val flowRun = dummyMsg.flowRun
   *     //your code here
   *   }
   * </pre>}}}
   *
   * @param code The code to be run in the flow. Its a function wich will be passed the flow instance, as well as the dummy
   *             root message.
   * @return The last expression in the code wrapped in a Future.
